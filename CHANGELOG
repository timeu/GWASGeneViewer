March 21, 2011 - Release 0.2.4
    * GWASGeneViewer (bugfix): if the bonferroniThreshold was higher than the max_value, the bonferroniThreshold, 
                               wouldn't be displayed. The max_value of the scatterplot will be displayed to the higher
                               value (bonferroniThreshold or max_value).

March 14, 2011 - Release 0.2.3
